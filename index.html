	Hello, my name is Wesley Foster. I was born in Texas and lived there for 22 years. After I graduated high school I went to college, I wasn't doing well, passed my classes but only barely.
I was more concerend with playing video games than doing my schoolwork.
My poor performance at college coupled with a job that I didn't wasn't going anywhere, I decided to enlist in the Air Force after some encouragement from a friend I made at college.
After Basic Training I was trained to be an aircraft maintainer, specializing in Communication & Naigation Systems, radios and radar basically. When my technical training was completed
I was sent to my first duty station in Washington (the state, not DC) and I LOVED IT there. I met my girlfriend within a few months of moving there on MySpace back when that site was still a thing.
Together we adopted a Husky-mix named Halo who would become my precious baby girl for the next 12 years. I lived in Washington for a little over 3 years, then I was sent to Japan. The first 2 years were rough because I didn't care for some of the people I worked with, but eventually they left and I began to enjoy the remaining 2 years I spent there. I spent 4 years in Japan and had spent a total of 8 years in the Air Force but I just wasn't feeling it anymore so I decided to separate, and went back home to Texas. I enrolled in college, the same one I struggled at prior to joining the military, and finished the Computer Science degree I started some 10 years prior, this time making all A's in every class I took.
After struggling to find a job I enjoyed, first at UPS which lasted all of 7 days, then at Fry's Electronics which lasted a little bit longer at a month, I rejoined the Air Force but in the Reserves, and at the same time I finally got a job I liked at Kohl's. I retrained into Fuels Management and did the Resesrve thing for 3 years until I transferred back to Acitve Duty, which was nearly 2 years ago.
I am currently in California, but my goal is to eventaully make it back to Washington, becuase throughout all my moves my girlfriend has remained in WA, we've been on-and-off a few times, but we've currently been together since 2016.

	I like to browse <a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> and surf <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lrj2Hq7xqQ8&ab_channel=LuisRedsVidal">YouTube</a> to pass the time. On <a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> I follow a handful of different subreddits but I also like to browse <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/all/">r/all</a> looking for different or interesting things that are outside my interests.
And on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lrj2Hq7xqQ8&ab_channel=LuisRedsVidal">YouTube</a> all of the channels I'm subscribed to fall into 3 categories; Educational <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey"><img src="CGP Grey.jpg"></a>, Music <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/leolego"><img src="FrogLeap Studios.jpg"></a>, and Video Games <a href="https://www.YouTube.com/extracredits"><img src="ExtraCredits.jpg"></a>
I almost always have a YouTube video playing for background noise while I'm playing games, like <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/">World of Warcraft</a>, <a href="http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/index.shtml">Final Fantasy XI</a>, or something on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>.

This was my baby girl Halo. She was making sure we didn't forget to bring her back home from vacation.
